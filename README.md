### Introduction to the 5G O-RAN Simulation Lab

Welcome to this hands-on lab where we will build a complete 5G mobile network from scratch using open-source software. The main objective is to explore the **O-RAN (Open Radio Access Network)** architecture. O-RAN is a modern standard that aims to open up mobile networks, which were traditionally closed, single-vendor systems. It achieves this by dividing the base station (the antenna) into smaller components with standard interfaces. This allows network operators to mix and match hardware and software from different manufacturers, fostering innovation. The key division introduced by O-RAN is the **RU-DU-CU** architecture, which separates the functions of the radio access network.

To understand this architecture, let's break down its parts.

1. **The RU (Radio Unit):** This is the layer closest to the user, located in the antenna. Its main function is radio frequency (RF) processing, including analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog signal conversion, amplification, and the transmission/reception of radio waves. It is the direct interface with user devices (UEs).

2. **The DU (Distributed Unit):** It handles real-time and latency-sensitive baseband processing functions, such as encoding/decoding, modulation/demodulation, and parts of the medium access control (MAC). It can be located at a cell site or a nearby data center. The DU connects to multiple RUs.

3. **The CU (Centralized Unit):** It performs upper-layer baseband functions and base station control, which are less latency-sensitive. This includes radio resource control (RRC), admission control, and mobility management functions. The CU connects to multiple DUs and, in turn, to the Core Network.

Every mobile network needs a central brain to manage users, security, and internet connectivity; this is called the **Core Network (or 5GC in 5G)**. In our lab, we'll be using **Open5GS**, an open-source project that implements a complete 5G Core. We chose it for its ease of use, stability, and because it's designed to run seamlessly in containers, simplifying deployment. The Core authorizes the user's device, known as the **User Equipment** (UE), which essentially authorizes your mobile phone to join the network.

To simulate the radio network (the RU-DU-CU part), we'll be using **srsRAN**. This is an amazing open-source software project that implements the entire 4G and 5G radio protocol stack. In our exercise, one srsRAN component will act as a **gNB** (the 5G base station), combining the functions of the **CU and DU** into a single program. Another srsRAN component will simulate the **UE** (the phone). To simulate the **RU** and the air link, srsRAN uses an ingenious *driver*, ZMQ, which replaces the radio frequency with a local network connection between our programs.

To build this complex environment on a single machine, we rely on **Docker**. This "container" technology allows us to package each component (the Core, the gNB, and the UE) into isolated software boxes. These boxes, or containers, are much lighter than virtual machines and ensure that one software's dependencies don't conflict with another's. All of this will run on our **host machine**, which is simply our physical computer (running a Linux operating system) that hosts the Docker software and all the containers that make up the network.

Once the network is up and running, we need to measure it. To do this, we'll use two essential tools. **Wireshark** is a "protocol analyzer" or *sniffer*, which allows us to capture and view every data packet flowing through the network; This is vital for debugging and understanding what the components are "talking" to each other. To generate traffic and measure performance, we'll use iperf3, a standard tool that acts as a speedometer to measure the maximum bandwidth our simulated network can handle.

The ultimate goal of these measurements is to evaluate performance and quality. We'll perform latency tests (also known as delay), which measures how long it takes for a packet to travel from the UE to the core and back; this is critical for interactive applications like online games. We'll also analyze QoS (Quality of Service), which is the network's ability to prioritize traffic. For example, a video call (sensitive to delay) should take priority over downloading a large file. Simulating and measuring this is fundamental to understanding how O-RAN architectures can deliver on the stringent performance promises of 5G.
